# uv-dynamic-versioning

[poetry-dynamic-versioning](https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning) influenced dynamic versioning tool for [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)/[hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch), powered by [dunamai](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai/).

## Installation

```bash
uv add uv-dynamic-versioning
```

Update or add `build-system` and `tool.hatch.version` in your `pyproject.toml` to use `uv-dynamic-versioning`.

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling", "uv-dynamic-versioning"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.version]
source = "uv-dynamic-versioning"
```

Also remove `version` in `project` and set `dynamic` (`dynamic = ["version"]`).

**Before**

```toml
[project]
name = "..."
version = "0.1.0"
```

**After**

```toml
[project]
name = "..."
dynamic = ["version"]
```

## Configuration

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Configuration is almost same to [poetry-dynamic-versioning](https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning). But `format-jinja`, `format-jinja-imports` are not supported.
> - The following descriptions are excerpts from [poetry-dynamic-versioning](https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning).

In your `pyproject.toml`, you may configure the following options:

- `[tool.uv-dynamic-versioning]`:
  General options.

  - `vcs` (string, default: `any`):
    This is the version control system to check for a version.
    One of: `any`, `git`, `mercurial`, `darcs`, `bazaar`, `subversion`, `fossil`, `pijul`.
  - `metadata` (boolean, default: unset):
    If true, include the commit hash in the version,
    and also include a dirty flag if `dirty` is true.
    If unset, metadata will only be included if you are on a commit without a version tag.
    This is ignored when `format` or `format-jinja` is used.
  - `tagged-metadata` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, include any tagged metadata discovered as the first part of the metadata segment.
    Has no effect when `metadata` is set to false.
    This is ignored when `format` or `format-jinja` is used.
  - `dirty` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, include a dirty flag in the metadata,
    indicating whether there are any uncommitted changes.
    Has no effect when `metadata` is set to false.
    This is ignored when `format` or `format-jinja` is used.
  - `pattern` (string):
    This is a regular expression which will be used to find a tag representing a version.
    When this is unset, Dunamai's default pattern is used.

    There must be a capture group named `base` with the main part of the version.
    Optionally, it may contain another two groups named `stage` and `revision` for prereleases,
    and it may contain a group named `tagged_metadata` to be used with the `tagged-metadata` option.
    There may also be a group named `epoch` for the PEP 440 concept.

    If the `base` group is not included,
    then this will be interpreted as a named preset from the Dunamai `Pattern` class.
    This includes: `default`, `default-unprefixed` (makes the `v` prefix optional).

    You can check the default for your installed version of Dunamai by running this command:

    ```bash
    poetry run python -c "import dunamai; print(dunamai.Pattern.Default.regex())"
    ```

    Remember that backslashes must be escaped in the TOML file.

    ```toml
    # Regular expression:
    pattern = '(?P<base>\d+\.\d+\.\d+)'
    # Named preset:
    pattern = "default-unprefixed"
    ```

  - `pattern-prefix` (string):
    This will be inserted after the pattern's start anchor (`^`).
    For example, to match tags like `some-package-v1.2.3`,
    you can keep the default pattern and set the prefix to `some-package-`.
  - `format` (string, default: unset):
    This defines a custom output format for the version. Available substitutions:

    - `{base}`
    - `{stage}`
    - `{revision}`
    - `{distance}`
    - `{commit}`
    - `{dirty}`
    - `{tagged_metadata}`
    - `{branch}`
    - `{branch_escaped}` which omits any non-letter/number characters
    - `{timestamp}` of the current commit, which expands to YYYYmmddHHMMSS as UTC

    Example: `v{base}+{distance}.{commit}`

  - `style` (string, default: unset):
    One of: `pep440`, `semver`, `pvp`.
    These are preconfigured output formats.
    If you set both a `style` and a `format`,
    then the format will be validated against the style's rules.
    If `style` is unset, the default output format will follow PEP 440,
    but a custom `format` will only be validated if `style` is set explicitly.
  - `latest-tag` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, then only check the latest tag for a version,
    rather than looking through all the tags until a suitable one is found to match the `pattern`.
  - `bump` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, then increment the last part of the version `base` by 1,
    unless the `stage` is set,
    in which case increment the `revision` by 1 or set it to a default of 2 if there was no `revision`.
    Does nothing when on a commit with a version tag.

    Example, if there have been 3 commits since the `v1.3.1` tag:

    - PEP 440 with `bump = false`: `1.3.1.post3.dev0+28c1684`
    - PEP 440 with `bump = true`: `1.3.2.dev3+28c1684`

  - `tag-branch` (string, default: unset):
    Branch on which to find tags, if different than the current branch.
    This is only used for Git currently.
  - `full-commit` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, get the full commit hash instead of the short form.
    This is only used for Git and Mercurial.
  - `strict` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, then fail instead of falling back to 0.0.0 when there are no tags.
  - `ignore-untracked` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, ignore untracked files when determining whether the repository is dirty.

Simple example:

```toml
[tool.uv-dynamic-versioning]
vcs = "git"
style = "semver"
```
